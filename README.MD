# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook utilizes various Python packages, including numpy, pandas, numba, vectorbt, and optuna. The notebook is structured to perform the following tasks:

<br>

## 1. Getting Price Data
   - In this section, we fetch OHLCV data for different assets with varying time intervals.

## 2. Creating Signal
   - An example signal is generated using fast and slow moving averages, along with RSI values.

## 3. Simple Backtest
   - A straightforward backtest is conducted with a basic configuration. The results include detailed statistics, various plots, and a transaction table for analysis.

## 4. Window Optimization
   - Optimal values for slow and fast moving averages are determined using the built-in grid search functionality of the vectorbt package.

## 5. Trailing Stop Loss & Take Profit
   - Custom functions are incorporated to set stop loss and take profit values.

## 6. FPE Box
   - The logic for the false positive elimination box is implemented in this section.

## 7. Grid Search
   - An ordinary grid search is performed for hyperparameter optimization.

## 8. Bayesian Search
   - A Bayesian search is executed for hyperparameter optimization using the optuna package.
